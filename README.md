## Description:

### Overview

This is a simple web application built using **Flask** for the backend and **SQLite** as the database. It allows users to register, log in, manage a to-do list, and use a timer feature. The application includes basic user authentication, adding and deleting to-do tasks, and a timer with an alarm notification when time is up.

The project includes a clean, responsive UI using **Bootstrap** for styling. JavaScript is used to manage the timer and handle asynchronous requests for adding and deleting tasks from the to-do list.

### Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can register, log in, and log out.
   - Passwords are hashed for security.
   
2. **To-Do List**:
   - Users can add tasks to their to-do list.
   - Tasks can be deleted using the "Delete" button.
   
3. **Timer**:
   - Users can set a timer with hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound is played, and a notification appears.

4. **Responsive UI**:
   - The application adapts to different screen sizes using **Bootstrap**'s grid system.

5. **Database**:
   - SQLite is used to store user data and tasks.
   - SQL queries are used to retrieve and manipulate data in the database.
